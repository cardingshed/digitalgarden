## homebrew
Need this.  Details on the homebrew [website](https://brew.sh)
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## git
Can use homebrew to install **git** - **git** is also included in **XCode** but that's about 15GB to install... 
```
brew install git
git --version
git config --global user.name <<my github username>>
git config --global user.email <<my email>>
```
