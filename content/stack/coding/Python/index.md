Image: [XKCD]("https://xkcd.com/1987/") shows what **not** to do, the way to avoid this is to use environments.  Following general plan of minimising bloat, I prefer to avoid conda (about 3GB of stuff I won't use). The general virtual environment choice is a bit of a [rabbit hole]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe") though.

## Prerequisites

Within VS Code environments add ```python``` to set up the development environment.
