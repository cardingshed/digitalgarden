Microsoft has bought GitHub, and hence also the text editor Atom. VS Code is a similar free, open-source in-house Microsoft product, and as at 2021 development efforts (for example Julia) seem to be favoured here.  

## Pre-requisites

VS Code Insiders can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) need the insiders build so the Jupyter notebook extension supports non-python kernels.

## Extensions

The extensions I select to extend functionality:

- julia
- latex workshop
- python
- jupyter (auto-installed with python)
