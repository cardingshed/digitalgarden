Minard's map of Napoleon's advance is a wonderful early example of data visualization, and much more dynamic than the static structures of 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5...

## tl;dr
1) Mainly appeals to white players who enjoy strategically clear positions, often black plays c4 and the position is blocked. 
2) Some barbarian white players gambit the d-pawn some dangerous varations to be move-by-move ready for.  
3) Final approach plays against c5: Kupreichik's Be3 can be avoided by playing Qb6 before Nc6, Steinitz used to take dc5 but this seems rare.

## so many crazy gambits

Milner-Barry gambit, Nbd2 gambit and so on all good clean fun
hope the links work?

## blocked positions with c4
some crazy game with a Kd7 Qg8 Qh7 manoeuvre to escape the pawn chain

## Ne7 or Nh6
can't remember how to get to Nf5 sure there was something about it

## Qb6 or Bd7
There's a strategy of Bb5 to exchange light-squared bishops, but it's probably rubbish

## white takes on c5 
some vague memory that Steinitz used to do this...
