  C07 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 c5 4.ed5 Qd5
  Scandinavian flavour to the French

Taking with the e-pawn would enter IQP territory, but white has Bb5+ ideas. The manoeuvre Qd5-d6 reminds me of Tiviakov, adding a Scandinavian flavour to the French defence.

Resources for this line:
+ *In-depth analysis of a variation* in **Luther's Chess Reformation**
+ Giri's chessable **French lifetime repertoire**
+ **Arkell's endings** by Keith Arkell

## tl;dr
1) Common ending where white has 3+3 and black has 2+4, is playable for a black win. Arkell prefers minority attack, Luther focusses on K-side majority.
2) The middlegame is more dangerous for black because white can have a scary K-side attack with the queens on.
3) Black can plan his own K-side attack with O-O-O and g5 etc.
